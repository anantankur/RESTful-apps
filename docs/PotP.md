# Purpouse of the Project

## What's special here

Maybe you've already seen open-source thing to work on one blog, but were them all working as fine as our thing works? I don't think so. Also, we'll stay free and open-source for EVERYONE.
Also, man, did you saw that works without registartion to work as a whole community and signing your work just at the bottom of article? Still, I don't think so.

## Why we're making that

We're doing great job and learning us in that way. You shall come with us. We're making this, because it can be useful for some apps that user can made by him/herself. For example, if you'll want to make blog-app just for yourself, you can modify our thing (but you need to remember about license thing).
